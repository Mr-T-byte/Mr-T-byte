#Hi! I'm Luiz Augusto

Welcome to my portfolio! Here are personal projects in **Python** (automation scripts) and **Java** (object-oriented programming), developed to demonstrate my initial programming skills.

I am studying **Software Engineering** at UCSal (starting in 2025) and am looking for opportunities in backend development, integrations, bug fixing, and technical support.

## Featured Projects

### Python - Automation
- **Inventory Manager**

Simple script to add/remove/list items and alert when stock is low.

Inspired by practical experience in inventory control. Folder: `/python-automation/stock_manager.py`

Technologies: Python (dictionaries, functions, loops)

(Add more projects here as you upload others!)

## Demonstrated Skills
- Programming logic and fundamentals in Python/Java
- Code organization and comments
- Use of Git/GitHub for version control
